# Robocopy-Based File Migration Tool

## Overview
This repository provides a **PowerShell-based Robocopy migration tool** designed for migrating **NFS/CIFS shares** from **NetApp, VNX, or Unity arrays** to **Dell PowerStore**. The tool ensures a **highly efficient, fault-tolerant, and automated data migration** experience while preserving **file permissions, timestamps, and integrity**.

## Key Features
- **Full Directory & ACL Migration**: Preserves all NTFS permissions, attributes, and timestamps.
- **Incremental Syncs**: Copies only changed or new files after the initial sync.
- **Multi-Threading for Performance**: Uses **Robocopyâ€™s /MT parameter** for fast transfers.
- **Error Handling & Logging**: Detailed logging to track failures and retry mechanisms.
- **Throttling & Auto Scheduling**:
  - Dynamically adjusts bandwidth usage based on configured schedules.
  - Ensures optimal network performance during migration.
- **HTML-Based Control Panel (Upcoming Feature)**:
  - A web-based interface to monitor and trigger migration jobs.
  - Provides job progress tracking, error reporting, and job history logs.
